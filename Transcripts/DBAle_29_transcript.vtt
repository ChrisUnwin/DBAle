30
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:39.210
Chris Unwin (He/They): But for now, Chris and I are going to play a little game with grant grant has prepared a number of statistics from the state of database devops reports.

31
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:54.660
Chris Unwin (He/They): And we are going to try and guess what database devops is like in 2021 so we've got we've got a fair bit of work ahead of us, of course, to do the work we're going to need one thing and that of course is.

32
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.850
Chris Unwin (He/They): What is it Chris.

33
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.440
Chris Kerswell: A drink.

34
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.420
Chris Unwin (He/They): A drink that's a very, very specific, very well, no sorry.

35
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.850
Chris Kerswell: So specific general.

36
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.280
Chris Unwin (He/They): it's a very nonspecific generalization of drink that Chris white why might, you have said, the word drink there oh.

37
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.750
Chris Kerswell: Because today i'm trying to be a little bit more healthy and not drink in February so as a result i've got my meager glass of water.

38
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.460
Chris Unwin (He/They): So the plan was for you to have non alcoholic beer.

39
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.460
Chris Kerswell: And unfortunately, Chris moved the.

40
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.530
Chris Kerswell: recording of today, so I didn't have a chance to go to the shop I.

42
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:53.010
Grant Fritchey: Well, I am drinking a fuller's ESB so there wasn't a whole lot of choice for British beer, it was it was this or what is it speckled hen.

43
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.710
Chris Unwin (He/They): I do love a speckled hen.

44
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.580
Chris Unwin (He/They): it's one of my favorites I do love us back would have.

45
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.130
Chris Unwin (He/They): Actually I don't think i've had one since going vegan energy, so I don't know if it's Chris you probably knows of spec would have vegan friendly.

46
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.020
Chris Kerswell: Already I expect we'll turn that.

47
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.760
Chris Unwin (He/They): Now right well fair enough never I.

48
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.610
Chris Kerswell: really like old crafty and that's a good.

49
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.630
Chris Unwin (He/They): One oh yeah I know.

50
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.910
Chris Kerswell: yeah I prefer the crafty one but that one's quite good to think there's an aged one as well, but that's hard to find.

51
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.260
Grant Fritchey: Okay now i've only ever seen the speckled hen and i'm not a fan.

52
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.790
Chris Unwin (He/They): well.

53
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:49.230
Chris Unwin (He/They): yeah one one day one day when all of this is over, all of this will be yours, we will make sure that when you're back over in the UK and we're all able to see and hug each other, I mean maybe not hug but you get the just will be able to go out and try all the different hands and.

54
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.730
Chris Unwin (He/They): Maybe we'll convert.

55
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.050
Chris Kerswell: Old golden.

56
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.410
Chris Unwin (He/They): golden hands nice I haven't had that in a while.

57
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:08.130
Chris Unwin (He/They): But today I am drinking in fact i've i've mentioned actually on a previous db l episode that I get deliveries of beer because that's who I am.

58
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:24.090
Chris Unwin (He/They): And today, I went for a lucky dip so I reached into one of these boxes of beer and I I pulled out a beer, that is from the moon dog craft brewery which is located in.

59
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:33.060
Chris Unwin (He/They): abbotsford Victoria in the lovely sunny i'm very envious of them because it's a beautiful amazing country.

60
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:50.250
Chris Unwin (He/They): Australia and, as you can see, if anyone is actually watching the actual recording it is just called as far as I can tell beer can, and it has the words beer can Emblazoned all around the can and not much else.

61
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.930
Chris Kerswell: On a funny topic here, but for anyone listening from Jamaica he's saying two separate worlds that beer and.

62
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.110
Chris Unwin (He/They): yeah.

63
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.860
Chris Unwin (He/They): he's just just inferring that i'm saying the word bacon.

64
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.710
Chris Unwin (He/They): Anyway, so the only description of this beer that I have is that it says it's a tropical Lager.

65
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.310
Chris Unwin (He/They): That that's that's it.

66
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:18.840
Chris Kerswell: information overload.

67
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:27.990
Chris Unwin (He/They): information overload it does also say that there's a 10 cent refund at collection depots in participating state or territories of purchase.

68
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.680
Chris Unwin (He/They): So i'm gonna i'm gonna have to travel a long way for that 10 cents, but it will be worth it.

69
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:44.340
Chris Unwin (He/They): Anyway, i'm gonna crack this open because grants already tackled his yeah 1130 bottoms up and Chris is on the water so.

70
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.550
Chris Unwin (He/They): Excellent.

71
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.590
Chris Unwin (He/They): And i'll pull this into my water glass, because you know no sense, using another glass.

72
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:54.750
Chris Unwin (He/They): save on washing up.

73
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.820
Chris Kerswell: And we'll watch you.

74
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.020
Chris Kerswell: just say the words beer can be can be.

75
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.530
Chris Unwin (He/They): There can be a chemical ooh.

76
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:13.080
Chris Unwin (He/They): it's got this lovely kind of I can only describe it as an almost pineapple the yellow color.

77
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.820
Grant Fritchey: And it does have.

78
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.550
Chris Unwin (He/They): It does have that tropical note to it as well.

79
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.220
Grant Fritchey: that's got a very golden look yeah.

80
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:30.540
Chris Unwin (He/They): Oh yeah that is considerably quotable I will I will get through that quite readily i'm sure.

81
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.390
Chris Kerswell: i'm not a beer in 15 days and I haven't been.

82
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.230
Chris Kerswell: A need for one until this point now on her feeling very.

83
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.930
Chris Unwin (He/They): Well, the last time I had a beer was the last ddl which I think is.

84
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.640
Chris Unwin (He/They): I don't know how long ago is, but it was a while ago.

85
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:48.450
Chris Kerswell: You should.

86
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.210
Chris Kerswell: cut down I don't know how long ago was.

87
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.150
Grant Fritchey: Generally don't drink beer unless i'm on the road.

88
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.360
Grant Fritchey: And I had to go out and buy this just for you guys.

89
00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:58.680
well.

90
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.240
Chris Unwin (He/They): Thank you.

91
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.870
Chris Unwin (He/They): Tremendous, so in that case, then there's no sense, no cents 10 cents.

92
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.780
Chris Unwin (He/They): you're wasting any more time i've got my beer grants got his beer.

93
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:20.340
Chris Unwin (He/They): Because Chris has got water i'm good right insert disappointed crowd noise here.

94
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:34.320
Chris Unwin (He/They): There we go that's what we think about your water but let's let's jump on to the main event, then so i'm going to hand over, of course, the reins to our host of the month, that being ground.

95
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.440
Grant Fritchey: Okay well let's start off at the top.

96
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:44.910
Grant Fritchey: How many people responded to our data or 21 state of database devops survey.

97
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.430
Chris Kerswell: Are we going to write it down and then review or do you want us to just blurt.

98
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.420
Grant Fritchey: I don't know blurted out.

99
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:58.080
Chris Unwin (He/They): yeah we can we can I mean I should I should be completely honest and i'm sure you know.

100
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:06.930
Chris Unwin (He/They): Wherever they are produced to the ways carly and and everyone who's involved in this report and tremendous amount of work, it is as well.

101
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:18.570
Chris Unwin (He/They): As probably going to be disappointed by the fact that I totally missed the the internal briefing that we had on it, so I literally know nothing I know zip zip.

102
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:29.100
Chris Unwin (He/They): I have received the recording and it is down, and I will be watching it tomorrow morning before work in my own time because that's time I should make up.

103
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:37.950
Chris Unwin (He/They): But I have purposefully just put off a couple of days reading some of the insights watching some of those insights just so that I know.

104
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:39.540
Chris Unwin (He/They): Nada.

105
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:50.910
Grant Fritchey: Why, I went and did to internal red gate demos on it i'm walk through one of them before i'm supposed to I got told later, but uh.

106
00:09:53.670 --> 00:10:01.320
Chris Unwin (He/They): Well, free information right we're we're big believers in in data and data is knowledge so yeah a little bit early can't hurt anyone.

107
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.590
Chris Kerswell: i'm gonna guess 2000.

108
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.820
Chris Unwin (He/They): i'm going to guess 2500.

109
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.470
Chris Unwin (He/They): Up higher.

110
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:19.920
Chris Unwin (He/They): Higher 3000 4000.

111
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.970
Grant Fritchey: Now now.

112
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.870
Grant Fritchey: 3247.

113
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.940
Chris Kerswell: What no that's.

114
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:34.410
Grant Fritchey: 50% more more than 50% above last year last year was 2000 That was our big push last year was to get to 2000.

115
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.650
Grant Fritchey: This year we made 3200.

116
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.970
Grant Fritchey: very exciting.

117
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.100
Chris Unwin (He/They): that's incredible so well done.

118
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.440
Grant Fritchey: It makes the the data.

119
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:45.390
More.

120
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:58.260
Grant Fritchey: Useful right the larger larger data set means that that the information and it has more meaning so it's it's i'm so excited about it this year, because we have so many respondents.

121
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.900
Chris Unwin (He/They): Nice well and.

122
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.020
Chris Unwin (He/They): Then I will take that point from UK as well.

123
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.330
Chris Kerswell: hey.

124
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.610
Chris Kerswell: So we just go for number of guesses.

125
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.110
Chris Kerswell: First guess was.

126
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.300
Chris Kerswell: close to the mind.

127
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.040
Chris Kerswell: Alright here's another concede let.

128
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:20.550
Grant Fritchey: me ask.

129
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.950
Grant Fritchey: Let me ask you this, do you think we had more.

130
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.840
Grant Fritchey: developers or db as a response to our survey.

131
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.100
Chris Unwin (He/They): that's a tough one.

132
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.500
Chris Unwin (He/They): you're going with developers.

133
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.960
Chris Kerswell: Just because there's more often that.

134
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.570
Chris Unwin (He/They): You say that.

135
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.620
Chris Kerswell: I mean that's 100% more developers than DPA is in the world.

136
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.540
Chris Unwin (He/They): I mean that's so Dr.

137
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.100
Grant Fritchey: About 500% more.

138
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:50.340
Are.

139
00:11:51.750 --> 00:12:04.170
Chris Unwin (He/They): i'm still going to go with dbs I think that you know it's a it's a report about database devops and I think as db as are increasingly becoming.

140
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:11.550
Chris Unwin (He/They): Like platform reliability engineers site reliability engineers database reliability engineers, you know.

141
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:22.320
Chris Unwin (He/They): they're gradually moving into a slightly more well I say slightly they've always been a more devops hero because they've always had to kind of interact with lots of different people and stuff so.

142
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:30.570
Chris Unwin (He/They): I I still feel like a lot of the information will come from those kind of subject matter experts.

143
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.910
Grant Fritchey: yeah sadly you're wrong.

144
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:41.040
Grant Fritchey: 41% were developers and only 16% were were dbs.

145
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.640
Chris Unwin (He/They): Oh ah, but a rose by any other name.

146
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:54.420
Grant Fritchey: Well, it could be database developers to I mean who knows, but i'm i'm sure i'm not sure what's in the details alright, so let me ask you another one on this.

147
00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:04.890
Grant Fritchey: What percentage are either architect or CIO sea level C suite leadership types.

148
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.560
Chris Kerswell: i'm okay with.

149
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:18.000
Chris Unwin (He/They): 2020 I think I think before I guess I think perhaps it might be worthwhile just.

150
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:27.210
Chris Unwin (He/They): it's really, really interesting because architects and cios do play a really important role in adopting database devops.

151
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:27.810
Grant Fritchey: Oh yeah.

152
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:39.300
Chris Unwin (He/They): I think you know from from experience it's very much a case that a lot of boards are pushing this kind of top level objective saying what we want is to.

153
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:55.200
Chris Unwin (He/They): be able to respond to the market, you know, we need to be able to pivot in the event of a business critical event, we need to respond to our customer base and nothing kind of highlighted that more than, say, you know the coronavirus or.

154
00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:02.130
Chris Unwin (He/They): The change it, you know, the world is changing, and there are going to be demands as we come out of lockdown and.

155
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:19.350
Chris Unwin (He/They): Businesses have to adopt and adapt and you know a lot of businesses at a top level are saying hey, we need to be ready to react at a moment's notice, and the only way to do that is to grab this monolithic massive thing this database.

156
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:24.000
Chris Unwin (He/They): and make it not monolithic and not like steering the Titanic.

157
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.620
Grant Fritchey: yeah.

158
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:29.760
Chris Kerswell: yeah.

159
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:36.930
Chris Kerswell: just starting to thought tonight well what analogy is represented by the the architect.

160
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:42.690
Chris Unwin (He/They): In.

161
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.550
Chris Kerswell: June.

162
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.850
Chris Kerswell: navigator or.

163
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:50.820
Chris Kerswell: Sorry, this is a complete aside.

164
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.320
Chris Unwin (He/They): I think doesn't.

165
00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.750
Chris Unwin (He/They): doesn't the architect, I mean.

166
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.370
Chris Unwin (He/They): The architect is the person that looks at the ship and goes.

167
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:10.500
Chris Unwin (He/They): yeah that's that's that's wildly horribly inefficient, what we need to do is chock this bit often chop that bit off and streamline this bit and then these are the people we need to have involved so they're kind of involved.

168
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:17.340
Chris Unwin (He/They): Their backup base of ship returns to base, and then they go right with decommissioning this and we're sending this new one out.

169
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.080
Chris Kerswell: far enough, and like RON said what's your guess.

170
00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:33.330
Chris Unwin (He/They): i'm gonna if we only had 16% db as responding i'm gonna go with.

171
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:41.010
Grant Fritchey: 8% 32.

172
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:41.700
know.

173
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:50.850
Grant Fritchey: 16 16% were analysts and architects and 16% were it leadership CIO cto director.

174
00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:52.830
Chris Unwin (He/They): that's incredible that's.

175
00:15:52.830 --> 00:16:05.730
Grant Fritchey: Yes, it's amazing yeah 30% of our respondents for that, for the survey where were you know decision makers, so this is fantastic information that's why.

176
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:12.870
Grant Fritchey: there's been they've been using ads with with my name on i'm saying i'm so excited about this, I could pop.

177
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.590
Grant Fritchey: it's like I haven't been able to share any of this stuff online with anyone until you know we published so.

178
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.860
Grant Fritchey: let's hold off it's been making me crazy.

179
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.040
Chris Unwin (He/They): wow that's that's crazy it's.

180
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.330
Chris Unwin (He/They): it's really great to see so many more people.

181
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:50.250
Chris Unwin (He/They): buying into you know hey we've realized that we can do all these amazing things on the application side you know we've done everything from upgraded the infrastructure to go in cloud native to you know deploying on to Cuban SES clusters and now it's like.

182
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.580
Chris Unwin (He/They): Did someone mentioned data and.

183
00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.070
Chris Unwin (He/They): People are really getting involved, which is.

184
00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.740
Chris Unwin (He/They): Great so yeah really nice to say.

185
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:05.730
Grant Fritchey: i'm excited about it so that brings up another one, let me ask you this, five years ago, when we first did the survey.

186
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.430
Grant Fritchey: Had 20% people saying that there is no way.

187
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.200
Grant Fritchey: They have no plans, they are not doing devops.

188
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:20.610
Grant Fritchey: What percentage is that now.

189
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.680
Chris Unwin (He/They): specifically for the database yeah.

190
00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:24.990
Grant Fritchey: yeah yeah database devops.

191
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.190
Chris Unwin (He/They): Okay well.

192
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:32.910
Grant Fritchey: I think this one's a general devops but but regardless, it was 20% said no, no way.

193
00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.280
Chris Kerswell: But, five years ago.

194
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.540
Grant Fritchey: yeah five years ago.

195
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:44.700
Chris Unwin (He/They): Why Why would anyone ever say no devops is a bad thing, I mean unless you were building a bridge but.

196
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.330
Chris Unwin (He/They): we're going to build this incrementally.

197
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.200
Chris Unwin (He/They): tested now.

198
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.570
Chris Kerswell: And then release it.

199
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.410
Chris Unwin (He/They): Minimum viable product minimum viable product is.

200
00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.910
Chris Unwin (He/They): build the dawn branch.

201
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:02.460
Chris Kerswell: Going Chris.

202
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:09.840
Chris Unwin (He/They): ooh i'm going to say now that that's probably closer to like 4%.

203
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.110
Chris Kerswell: Or, so a little bit i'm gonna go with 10%.

204
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.360
Grant Fritchey: Mr curse well is close.

205
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:26.160
Grant Fritchey: it's 11% but it's it's cut in half it's 50%.

206
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:33.210
Grant Fritchey: You know it's been cut in half over the last five years, so there's you know 20% of people said there's no way.

207
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:48.510
Grant Fritchey: Interestingly enough, the same numbers of people are like who are planning to adopt went from 30% down to 15 because the number of people who have at least done some of it has gone from 12 to 26 and from 35 to 48.

208
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.050
Chris Unwin (He/They): wow OK, so the people who were planning are actually.

209
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.090
Chris Kerswell: Doing yeah.

210
00:18:54.660 --> 00:19:04.500
Grant Fritchey: yeah yeah I mean 70 some odd percent of people have at least some devops in their in their you know at least what they're calling devops in their processes.

211
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:09.630
Chris Unwin (He/They): whining and then actually rolling out Chris you could stand to learn something here for our team.

212
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:15.090
Grant Fritchey: yeah and that's.

213
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:20.610
Grant Fritchey: that's from 47% five years ago, so I mean it's you know.

214
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.630
Grant Fritchey: devops has arrived, I mean I mean it's just.

215
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:34.050
Grant Fritchey: Our first survey, five years ago it was less than half of all people have any kind of devops at all, and now it's 74% I mean that's it.

216
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:43.590
Chris Unwin (He/They): it's kind of interesting isn't it you kind of feel like with so many people doing devops and when so many people are aiming to do devops.

217
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:52.980
Chris Unwin (He/They): And you know we're using this as a very general kind of blanket term right doing devops obviously involves a huge amount of work.

218
00:19:53.430 --> 00:20:13.440
Chris Unwin (He/They): You know in with both your with your personnel with your processes with your technology involves a tremendous amount of planning rollout and buy in but like do you feel like there's going to be a point at which we just stopped saying devops and it just becomes standard working practice.

219
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:27.270
Grant Fritchey: yeah oh yeah I think so already I mean I mean cuz I first started doing devops it didn't have a name, we just I mean, I see this joke all the time is i'm gonna have to stop saying at some point we just thought it was our job.

220
00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:41.220
Grant Fritchey: didn't have a title we just did it because it was like automate this automate that make it all run fast, so we can support more teams, so we can do more work, so we can run faster, so we can do more, you know.

221
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.640
Grant Fritchey: That was just how we were getting stuff done.

222
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.180
Grant Fritchey: Then we come to find out it actually had a name it's kind of cool.

223
00:20:48.630 --> 00:21:07.020
Chris Unwin (He/They): yeah and that's The interesting thing, as well as getting it done is very synonymous with devils because if you take that whole phrase, and just break it down into hey just do it right it's a phrase very near and dear to the heart of our of our founder Simon Galbraith.

224
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.510
Chris Kerswell: Just just likes microphones.

225
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:19.680
Chris Unwin (He/They): I Okay, just to make sure that I don't infringe on coffee right then i'm going to say just get something done.

226
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.730
Chris Unwin (He/They): Which is my my knockoff brand.

227
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:35.160
Chris Unwin (He/They): So you want to just get something done the actual kind of intonation of that is hey do it now do it, you know do it in short sprint's.

228
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:42.600
Chris Unwin (He/They): Do something right stop being paralyzed with decisions and actually make a decision.

229
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:52.860
Chris Unwin (He/They): it's kind of like the lean it principles, where, if you keep you know you do differ decisions, but when you have enough information you make that decision you go ahead and do the thing.

230
00:21:53.190 --> 00:22:01.620
Chris Unwin (He/They): So it's really nice, I think it really embodies the spirit of devops which is great that you've got the aurora borealis behind you on your.

231
00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:03.570
Chris Unwin (He/They): On your background as.

232
00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:07.680
Chris Unwin (He/They): Well, I kind of feel like you're just being a washed with like devops rays.

233
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.300
Grant Fritchey: Just rub devops on my mess it makes it feel better just all you need.

234
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:14.910
Chris Unwin (He/They): blimey.

235
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.770
Grant Fritchey: Okay here's fun one.

236
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:29.700
Grant Fritchey: us in terms of you know, enterprise midsize businesses or small businesses, what percentage of enterprise businesses have adopted across all projects.

237
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.090
Chris Kerswell: ooh who projects.

238
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:41.520
Chris Unwin (He/They): Enterprise so enterprise enterprise organizations and all projects.

239
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:42.120
yeah.

240
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:58.650
Chris Unwin (He/They): hmm yeah that's a tough one, because, on one hand enterprises are being you know pushed by the people who are disrupting the market you've got you know.

241
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:12.990
Chris Unwin (He/They): banking and finance all of a sudden, having to adopt new working practices or else they're just left behind by the competition, but at the same time they're also the people who have a billion different projects all on at the same time.

242
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:13.920
yeah.

243
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:17.010
Chris Kerswell: All projects.

244
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.790
Chris Kerswell: Chris give us.

245
00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.130
Grant Fritchey: Give us a number make a guess.

246
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:33.720
Chris Kerswell: 12 12% who I see, I thought I was going to lowball and go for like 30 but that's that's even.

247
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.260
Chris Unwin (He/They): yeah but.

248
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:38.130
Chris Unwin (He/They): All projects every single project.

249
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:39.660
Chris Kerswell: All right, i'm gonna go with 20.

250
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.800
Grant Fritchey: Ah, Mr curse well as winning again.

251
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.270
Grant Fritchey: or.

252
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:45.990
Third.

253
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.760
Grant Fritchey: yeah.

254
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.020
Chris Unwin (He/They): Oh, I guess, I thought you said, half the guests, in which case I was right.

255
00:23:55.110 --> 00:24:00.030
Grant Fritchey: Okay, so now what percentage of medium sized businesses have all.

256
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.230
Chris Unwin (He/They): You get to go first this time cuz well because.

257
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.660
Chris Unwin (He/They): i've been first the last couple times and you've just like gone in slightly above me.

258
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.190
Chris Kerswell: And we go, yes, the edging type be greatly just edge them out.

259
00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.630
Chris Kerswell: 70% is what i'm going to go with.

260
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.950
Chris Unwin (He/They): Oh.

261
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.410
Chris Kerswell: i'm locking user a medium.

262
00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:29.400
Chris Unwin (He/They): Your i'm gonna go with 69%.

263
00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.100
Grant Fritchey: Both wildly wrong 20%.

264
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.140
Chris Unwin (He/They): Ah ha.

265
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:44.880
Grant Fritchey: difference, so what percentage of small companies have off of their projects on.

266
00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:59.400
Chris Unwin (He/They): i'm going to repeat my 69 right now, I think I think now we get into small companies who only have like one or two simultaneous projects on 100% well not hundred percent but i'm 100% positive is gonna be high.

267
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:06.420
Chris Kerswell: yeah I mean traditionally you think greenfield is much easier to do this kind of stuff and.

268
00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:12.330
Chris Unwin (He/They): Small Business not equal necessarily greenfield, though, like you, could be a small.

269
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:16.350
Chris Unwin (He/They): Business we have been around for like 50 years.

270
00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:17.550
Chris Kerswell: ago.

271
00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.390
Chris Unwin (He/They): With a 60% 24 number.

272
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.700
Grant Fritchey: that's exactly the same across all three.

273
00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:28.740
Grant Fritchey: But here's the thing.

274
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:38.100
Grant Fritchey: Is because we're all leaning towards a will medium is going to have more in small is going to have more, but in fact the enterprise is got the largest percentage of adoption by far.

275
00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:46.350
Grant Fritchey: 46% have dropped it across some projects as opposed to 39 for medium sized businesses and 31 for small.

276
00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:48.990
Chris Kerswell: Never just the.

277
00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.750
Grant Fritchey: Enterprise enterprises are leading the charge on devops.

278
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:56.100
Chris Unwin (He/They): that's interesting, we could I say i'm sure we could speculate why.

279
00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:08.520
Chris Unwin (He/They): i'm i'm honestly quite flabbergasted if i'm if i'm honest I did not expect those figures to be like they are maybe enterprises have the resources or.

280
00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:19.050
Chris Kerswell: you're you're right when you when you kind of roll with the punches now when when I think enterprise, I think, great big monolithic organization they can't move toward the Titanic.

281
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:34.740
Chris Kerswell: Trying to avoid the iceberg, and I think smallest like that few developers, who are starting their own company, for the first time, but you know you're right small company could be like an accountancy firm that's been around for 100 years.

282
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:41.940
Grant Fritchey: yeah yeah it's pretty fun um let's see let's get another one.

283
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.250
Chris Unwin (He/They): i'm enjoying this this I could.

284
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:50.490
Chris Unwin (He/They): Do How long have we got for ddl today because i'm thinking i'm thinking like a three hour bumper special.

285
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:54.210
Chris Kerswell: I was hoping i'd be able to eat today but we'll see.

286
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.190
Chris Unwin (He/They): Did you not have lunch.

287
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.400
Chris Kerswell: lunch, but you need second lunch and dinner, and secondly.

288
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.220
Chris Unwin (He/They): I don't know if he knows about second dinner pip.

289
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:09.900
Grant Fritchey: Alright, so here's a fun one.

290
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:15.300
Grant Fritchey: um barriers and challenges to implementing devops okay.

291
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:16.230
Chris Unwin (He/They): Link service.

292
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:19.980
Grant Fritchey: replication.

293
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.560
Grant Fritchey: Set me on fire anyway.

294
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:27.060
Grant Fritchey: um.

295
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:36.030
Grant Fritchey: What was or what would be the main obstacle to implementing a devops approach in your organization was one of the questions we asked and we got a lot of responses.

296
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:43.770
Grant Fritchey: One of the responses, is a classic and its lack of support from executive leadership.

297
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.480
Grant Fritchey: is one of the reasons for people not being able to implement devops.

298
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:58.710
Grant Fritchey: What percentage of people today not five years ago today cuz cuz, this is an interesting thing.

299
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.370
Grant Fritchey: How many people are not able to get executive leadership.

300
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.790
Chris Unwin (He/They): Well, as you go work for the companies where these cios and architects are filling in the report work.

301
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:09.810
Grant Fritchey: yeah no kidding.

302
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:20.340
Chris Kerswell: Trying to remember the number habits that they had no plans to adopt devops.

303
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.540
Chris Kerswell: Was 1111.

304
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.780
Grant Fritchey: yeah because you were one off you had you get 10.

305
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:30.360
Chris Unwin (He/They): i'm.

306
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:31.410
Chris Kerswell: gonna go with.

307
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:36.630
Chris Unwin (He/They): 20% 20% like this year.

308
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:42.330
Chris Unwin (He/They): That are blocked by executive buy in i'm gonna go with 34%.

309
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:44.010
Grant Fritchey: eight.

310
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:46.710
Chris Kerswell: wow.

311
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:56.730
Grant Fritchey: 8% that's radically down over the last five years, all right, we don't I don't have the numbers in front of me to tell you exactly what but it's radically down.

312
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:57.390
Chris Unwin (He/They): So.

313
00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.120
Grant Fritchey: What do you think what you think the number one Blocker is.

314
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:16.800
Chris Unwin (He/They): going to be time isn't it time firefighting Oh, I would implement better proactive monitoring across these hundred servers but unfortunately I just all these darn weight stats that I just I need to focus on every day.

315
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:24.510
Chris Kerswell: Is a good call out, I was thinking, it would be time money or culture.

316
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:39.390
Chris Unwin (He/They): um I think we're getting past the point now where people think that devops is a bad thing, like if you've got executive buy in and you've got technical buy in then realistically if middle managers.

317
00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:48.420
Chris Unwin (He/They): don't buy in then they've got to deal with it from both directions so it's it's got to be I am under resourced I don't have the time to do this or that.

318
00:29:48.930 --> 00:30:02.160
Chris Unwin (He/They): Or that people are skills hoarding you know oh it's kind of like the phoenix project right Brent is hoarding all of the knowledge of various systems and because we don't do a good job of spreading that knowledge.

319
00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:07.770
Chris Unwin (He/They): diversifying the skills within our own workforce, then things go.

320
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:09.120
Grant Fritchey: Right.

321
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:12.360
Grant Fritchey: Well, you ready.

322
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.200
Chris Kerswell: Oh yeah.

323
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.660
Grant Fritchey: Lack of appropriate skills is.

324
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:25.980
Grant Fritchey: number two is time is the disruption to the business disruption to existing workflows which I think I think when you say time I think it's exactly what they mean.

325
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.950
Grant Fritchey: yeah that's it was really interesting.

326
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:35.910
Grant Fritchey: Cultural resistance as as a top challenge is only 15% most people are.

327
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:48.540
Grant Fritchey: People are shifting cultures it, it is literally a lack of skills, that is, is the one the one thing limiting people from implementing it, which is awesome for us.

328
00:30:48.570 --> 00:31:04.260
Chris Unwin (He/They): So grand in that case, then obviously you were saying that you've implemented devops a long, long time before you even knew it was called devops right, and this is yeah not many years ago, but some years ago.

329
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.820
Grant Fritchey: It was quite a few years.

330
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:06.960
Chris Unwin (He/They): All right, we'll say.

331
00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:18.120
Chris Unwin (He/They): we'll say 10 years ago so 10 years ago you've implemented devops at your organization, what kind of cultural push back, did you get and was it an executive thing or was it a technical colleague.

332
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.750
Grant Fritchey: Honest to God we did it and it was, by the way, 15 years ago.

333
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:26.460
Chris Kerswell: wasn't born lemons fun.

334
00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:31.890
Chris Unwin (He/They): was born, it was 2006 and I was 15.

335
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:34.470
Grant Fritchey: and

336
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:57.150
Grant Fritchey: The main resistance was me the main resistance was technical um we might myself and the db team were adamant that we can't automate deployments that it's just not something you can do, let alone, something that you want to do, and so yeah we fought them tooth and nail.

337
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:09.360
Grant Fritchey: Ultimately, I had, I had a couple of really good Dev friends who kind of walked me through why the ci thing continuous integration.

338
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:21.180
Grant Fritchey: was useful and then, if we could get ci that we could get automated deployments to QA and if we could do you know if we could do that, then we could you know what I mean and it just the whole ball started to roll and you realize.

339
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:23.850
Grant Fritchey: You okay so i'm wrong.

340
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:33.480
Grant Fritchey: And i've got now you know pony up and help them get the work done but, but I was the resistance, it was technical.

341
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:44.880
Grant Fritchey: Business was very much you know, like go faster, you know tablets are like we think this will go faster so they're like yes, then do it just do it do it.

342
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:57.480
Grant Fritchey: And and that's where you know that's how it went, but it was the resistance was internal it was not the hierarchy, it was very much a technical resistance.

343
00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:58.260
Grant Fritchey: Sign I.

344
00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.170
Grant Fritchey: I wouldn't be surprised if you see that still all over the place.

345
00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:11.700
Chris Unwin (He/They): So you know realistically in your story, then, and probably is the case for many people, both who listen to db L and you know, let us know if this is similar to your story obviously we'd love to know.

346
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:26.100
Chris Unwin (He/They): but also many, many other people as well, will be dealing with that similar situation where they will either be the people with that growth mindset that coach mindset where they're looking to improve working practices.

347
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:33.690
Chris Unwin (He/They): But if if you just in a few short sentences, if you could talk to yourself 15 years ago.

348
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:38.970
Chris Unwin (He/They): When you were blocking a devops approach, what would you say.

349
00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:54.810
Grant Fritchey: Well it's the same I do I do I tell that story now because I will I tell I will go to the developers conferences and say here's how you can venture de BA and I will go to tba conferences and say listen to me you idiots.

350
00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:06.390
Grant Fritchey: But um no i'm not saying that and I know I don't call people names and that's very much a joke, but what I will say is i'm.

351
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:15.330
Grant Fritchey: devops ads protection to your production servers i'm protection that you couldn't get other ways so.

352
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:24.570
Grant Fritchey: source control ads you know, an additional backup and an additional way to do on dues and track, who made what changes, you know so you've got auditing.

353
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:35.640
Grant Fritchey: And all that stuff from source control the automation ads testing that you couldn't get other ways which adds protection to your production servers and and to me that's.

354
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.730
Grant Fritchey: that's the showstopper as a DPA.

355
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:42.360
Grant Fritchey: What i'm making my servers safer.

356
00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:51.570
Grant Fritchey: huh okay sign me up where you know take my money, you know how do I, how do I get on you know subscribe like and subscribe.

357
00:34:51.930 --> 00:35:04.710
Chris Unwin (He/They): So i've i've taken one thing away from this that is obviously devops makes deployments safer and it's great to see more people doing that and Chris can take one thing away from this in that calling people names is not a nice way to be.

358
00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.150
Chris Kerswell: shut up video.

359
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:13.560
Chris Kerswell: Thank you for that contribution you're welcome.

360
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:17.400
Chris Unwin (He/They): So should we do, should we do one more one or two one.

361
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:17.610
More.

362
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:19.890
Grant Fritchey: let's see.

363
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:25.740
Grant Fritchey: This one's fun.

364
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:28.860
Grant Fritchey: This one's fun because it's messed up.

365
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:42.870
Grant Fritchey: that's right up my time Okay, so we we stratified some of the data like so people who are doing lots of you know, like and and the way you know, we asked the questions and stuff we got the feedback from people.

366
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:53.160
Grant Fritchey: And so we stratified some of the data there's the elite devops people you know who are doing like you know they're just devops monsters, and then there's the low devops people, people who are just.

367
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:58.260
Grant Fritchey: Either you're not at all, or are very, very minimal.

368
00:35:58.290 --> 00:35:59.100
Chris Unwin (He/They): dipping your toe in.

369
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.930
Grant Fritchey: yeah and.

370
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:12.930
Grant Fritchey: So you know breaking it down elite high medium and low and like if you talk about something like version control the elite is 69% of the elite are doing version control.

371
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:18.900
Grant Fritchey: 68% of the higher doing version control 68% of the medium are doing version control.

372
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:34.920
Grant Fritchey: version control is you know something that a lot of people do the low end is 62% which I still think that that's a lie, but fine because that's databases like code in the database is in source control now here's the weird one.

373
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.340
Grant Fritchey: static code analysis.

374
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:48.420
Grant Fritchey: Who do you think does it more elite high medium or low and what percentage do they do.

375
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.370
Chris Unwin (He/They): static code analysis for database code specifically.

376
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.350
Grant Fritchey: Specifically database good.

377
00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:02.520
Chris Kerswell: that's a tricky one and the fight you laid out like this makes me think it's the unexpected result.

378
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.260
Chris Kerswell: So i'm going to go with the low do it the most.

379
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:11.730
Chris Kerswell: And i'm gonna go with 40%.

380
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:36.960
Chris Unwin (He/They): I, I think that none of them will do it particularly well because static code analysis, much like testing is really hard in databases like it's not it's not like you put a thing there and magic happens right like static code analysis you're in vs code or visual studio you've got your.

381
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:42.150
Chris Unwin (He/They): you've got your various plugins what's the.

382
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:45.930
Chris Unwin (He/They): that's fine I it's.

383
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.410
Grant Fritchey: My you're.

384
00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:51.810
Chris Unwin (He/They): My best let it be let it be known to the record that my beer has been gone for at least five minutes.

385
00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:54.420
Chris Kerswell: A lot of hiccups from us.

386
00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:04.770
Chris Unwin (He/They): Oh that's fine, so the yeah you've got your jet brains plugin in visual studio and it's you know, highlighting all your all your various issues.

387
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:07.740
Chris Unwin (He/They): But with database code.

388
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:19.440
Chris Unwin (He/They): i'm going to say that the medium performers did slightly better but i'm still convinced that they're probably only about 28%.

389
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.480
Grant Fritchey: i'm going to give this one, to Mr on one.

390
00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:29.310
Grant Fritchey: Yes, because it's 28% is the number.

391
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:30.420
Grant Fritchey: One, but it is.

392
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:31.710
Chris Unwin (He/They): Low performers.

393
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:33.900
Grant Fritchey: Oh no performers did.

394
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:43.590
Grant Fritchey: 28% and the high did 24%, this is the only place where the high performers and the low performers swapped the only place.

395
00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:52.980
Grant Fritchey: In fact, the high performers outperform everybody on everything except static code analysis and makes me think it's either.

396
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:58.020
Grant Fritchey: there's just not a lot of adoption on that on that concept yet or.

397
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:05.130
Grant Fritchey: it's a statistical anomaly, or maybe people know something I don't.

398
00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.030
Chris Unwin (He/They): Maybe, because the boys together.

399
00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.090
Chris Kerswell: How many people have responded to this question.

400
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:17.070
Grant Fritchey: yeah that I don't know i'll have to get had to get that one because it yeah it could be a statistical just a.

401
00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.970
Chris Kerswell: 28% means that there must be at least.

402
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:31.080
Chris Kerswell: say enough i'd say like I said would be at least seven people respond to.

403
00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:32.670
Chris Kerswell: mind.

404
00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:41.670
Grant Fritchey: Well, and I mean we've got I mean there was 3200 responded so I mean, so I would think that any of these questions you're going to get at least five or 10 people answering one way or the other.

405
00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:53.460
Chris Unwin (He/They): There was a question that had fewer than 10 responded out of 3200 people filling it out, I would relate I would be questioning whether or not that question belongs in.

406
00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.220
Chris Kerswell: What what could have happened is that everyone.

407
00:39:56.310 --> 00:40:00.600
Chris Kerswell: puts himself down as high, and so, then you'd if you only get say.

408
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:07.890
Chris Kerswell: Seven people respond to like as the lower than when you stretch five any device down.

409
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.420
Chris Unwin (He/They): Christmas.

410
00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.140
Grant Fritchey: I think the degree that we asked a series of questions to get people.

411
00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:15.450
Chris Kerswell: You know how frequently do.

412
00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:24.780
Grant Fritchey: Do deployments How long do they take you know all this stuff and and those numbers were how we did the stratification it wasn't simply self identification.

413
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:33.750
Chris Unwin (He/They): I was gonna say then everyone will self identity yeah i'm doing i'm doing I was on I was on a call with a with a company literally last week.

414
00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:47.760
Chris Unwin (He/They): And I won't name them, obviously, but the it was it was me the their account manager and also a number of high stakeholders so you've got various architects and db a's and developers.

415
00:40:48.390 --> 00:41:06.900
Chris Unwin (He/They): And one person just unmuted and said yeah we like to think we're an agile shop, but actually we're more like a waterfall shop who pretends to be doing agile and everyone unmuted and was like yes that's true yes definitely not 100% what and I was like huh.

416
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:18.750
Chris Unwin (He/They): Okay, but a lot of people self identify still as being yeah high performing I would say we do devops do we have version control no static code analysis, no see I know CD no.

417
00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:24.570
Chris Unwin (He/They): Do developers write scripts and deploy them to prod because we don't have access control sometimes.

418
00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:31.080
Chris Kerswell: Is a previous company I worked at one of the projects that had an internal name of glacier.

419
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:45.270
Chris Kerswell: And the reason was that the the people, people doing it, and said that they were developers were used to work in waterfall failing to do agile and so the end result was glacier.

420
00:41:51.060 --> 00:42:02.040
Grant Fritchey: Well anyway there's a bunch more data in the report, all kinds of cool stuff cloud adoption um how frequently people are doing their database releases.

Grant Fritchey: The the amount of information in here is just so cool.

423
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:32.700

436
00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:48.090
Chris Unwin (He/They): High medium low performer whether you want something to take to that you know to those executives or to that cultural push back to say hey look we're not if we do this we're not being left in the dust Okay, this is a worthwhile investment of our time.

Chris Unwin (He/They): So we've we've got very, very short amount of time left, we do have, as far as I can tell from as far as I can tell from planning, we had a data breach each data each.

505
00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.820
Chris Unwin (He/They): Chris did you investigate one or two other.

506
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:20.670
Chris Kerswell: I investigated both there wasn't a huge amount of information really on either, but i'll go with.

507
00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:24.240
Chris Kerswell: Which one do you want to take rest okay.

508
00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:28.650
Chris Unwin (He/They): I wanted to do so i'm going to start off with.

509
00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:31.500
Chris Unwin (He/They): The meat mindful breach.

510
00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:42.240
Chris Unwin (He/They): I think that's really interesting so effectively data belonging to the website meet mindful.com, which is a dating site.

511
00:52:42.990 --> 00:53:09.780
Chris Unwin (He/They): was actually breached, so it was about 2.28 million users were breached, it was basically dumped on a forum, it was a 1.2 gigabyte file of just the site's users database and included, but was not limited to real names email addresses dating preferences marital status latitude and longitude.

512
00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:11.640
Chris Unwin (He/They): IP addresses.

513
00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:18.990
Chris Unwin (He/They): Be crypt hashed account passwords and Facebook user ids and authentication tokens.

514
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:21.450
Chris Kerswell: yeah that last one is the big one.

515
00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:23.250
Chris Kerswell: wow whoa.

516
00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:32.550
Chris Unwin (He/They): yeah, so this is kind of big kind of sensitive obviously there was a breach few years back, as well, I can't remember what it was, it was the.

517
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:37.650
Chris Unwin (He/They): It was like an elite dating site, or something.

518
00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:38.640
Chris Unwin (He/They): That had a data breach.

519
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:39.930
Chris Kerswell: Talking about the cheating one.

520
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:57.810
Chris Unwin (He/They): Yes, the secret affairs site, or whatever I can't remember anyway, the this one's obviously not specifically that it's just a dating site, but at the same time, the thing that stuck out to me is not particularly massive I still 2.28 million people, which is a lot.

521
00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:08.790
Chris Unwin (He/They): it's the set it's the data points in the file specifically like the the Facebook user ids and off tokens the yo.

522
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:17.460
Chris Unwin (He/They): All of the information that was included is just so sensitive that you don't really even know be correct is pretty secure.

523
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:28.530
Chris Unwin (He/They): But you don't even need that really to tie back to a person's identity, so I just thought it was really, really interesting and this one was this I saw this one posted on.

524
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.220
Chris Unwin (He/They): On zeb dinette zed net.

525
00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:35.100
Chris Kerswell: pronounced either I was wondering is.

526
00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:41.130
Chris Unwin (He/They): But it was on the 24th of January that it was it was highlighted that I picked up on it.

527
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.080
Chris Kerswell: just in time for valentine's day.

528
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.040
Chris Unwin (He/They): just in time.

529
00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:51.480

Chris Unwin (He/They): Was Chinese Internet pokemon Chinese if you play pokemon you've got a very.

531
00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:01.410
Chris Unwin (He/They): miniscule chance of finding a shiny pokemon.

532
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:09.630
Chris Kerswell: So this individual is I guess by her name for themselves, and someone who exposes a lot of personal information online.

533
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:10.980
Chris Kerswell: Recently did this.

534
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.740
Chris Kerswell: With a company called T spring as well.

535
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:22.650
Chris Kerswell: Okay didn't actually seem to hack it themselves into by the data on the dark web and then expose it whatever reason.

536
00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:27.060
Chris Unwin (He/They): The interesting and the final one for today, then Chris.

537
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:36.300
