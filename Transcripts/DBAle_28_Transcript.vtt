00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.690
Chris Kerswell: Okay, well, if anybody out there is wondering what song this is.

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.410

Chris Kerswell: Pretty sure let's get ready to rumble, the only song as well.

15
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.490
Chris Kerswell: Just song in slightly different ways.

16
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.000
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I honestly byker Grove was a little bit before my time so

17
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.600

23
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:40.530
Chris Unwin (He/Him): But that's fine, don't worry. We soldier on we stay safe we stay indoors. We stay near the beer because I don't want anyone pinching it

24
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:51.930
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Of course you are joining us here for DBS 28 the episode that we are affectionately referring to as the January bruise.

25
00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:12.570
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And it's actually all the more pertinent. I think that we're recording it on what is termed Blue Monday, but we'll get into that in just a moment. Of course, my name is the wonderful the obnoxious. The. A little bit yeah he's all right, Chris.

26
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.610
Chris Kerswell: And I'm also Chris

27
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.860
Chris Kerswell: Probably

28
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.580
Chris Unwin (He/Him): All right, Chris don't need to talk. My arm off about it, geez.

29
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.150
Chris Unwin (He/Him): But no, seriously, Chris, how are you

30
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.350
Chris Kerswell: I'm doing pretty good. Thank you. How are you, I'm a little tired, actually.

31
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.420
Chris Kerswell: Yeah, but otherwise I'm good. Yeah.

32
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:46.050
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Nice. Well, yeah, I'm very good to thank you and i think that's that's something that we take a little bit for granted is asking people how they are you join a meeting you speak to someone, you say, Hey, how are you, and they go, Yeah, I'm fine.

33
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.330
Chris Unwin (He/Him): But the problem is

34
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.010
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Is that just a gut reaction, do we just say, Yeah, I'm fine, because that's what the other person expects to hear

35
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:06.210
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Well, this and obviously a couple of other topics will be tackling on this particular session. No, we're not going to be talking so much about

36
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.820
Chris Unwin (He/Him): To databases and to data's and the DevOps and all that sort of wonderful techie goodness, but actually in this particular DBS

37
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:25.380
Chris Unwin (He/Him): We're going to be talking a little bit more about beating the January blues about doing something that makes you a little bit happier and making something that doing something that

38
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:36.000
Chris Unwin (He/Him): You know, helps you fight off that just that dark nurse that cold that whatever it is that usually comes with January.

39
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:49.800
Chris Unwin (He/Him): So today's episode we're going to basically go into 10 of mine and Chris's top tips for how to beat the January blues. Isn't that right, Chris.

40
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.390
Chris Kerswell: Yeah, well I do kind of feel for the people who get depressed in July.

41
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.810
Chris Kerswell: I better get this big push

42
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.940
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Well, I mean, the interesting thing is Blue Monday itself was actually a hoax created by the travel industry.

43
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.520
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And effectively.

44
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.440
Chris Kerswell: If this is ready to buy an industry is a hoax or a marketing gimmick.

45
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.270
Chris Unwin (He/Him): It's a marketing gimmick.

46
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.060
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Basically created by the travel industry effectively to inspire people to

47
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:36.270
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Book holidays right you know to go away somewhere sunny somewhere nice to spend that money. Interesting point of fact, though, is that

48
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:55.740
Chris Unwin (He/Him): It is it it's not making light of people who are really going through stuff right now. You know, there's a lot of people who are going through stuff right now and again this will all be on the discussion as we get into our main theme, lest we once again head off on a ridiculous tangent

49
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.100
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Never. That doesn't sound like us at all.

50
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:08.550
Chris Unwin (He/Him): But we do have some good news to start off with, I realized that the news is kind of our end thing, but we do have some news for the beginning

51
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.760
Chris Kerswell: Some beginning news news.

52
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.990
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Do you have a good theme song that we could use for the news at the beginning.

53
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.540
Chris Kerswell: Kind of wanted to go off of. Let's get ready to rumble song, but I don't do it justice.

54
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:33.660
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Let's get ready to read news now. That sounded that that cadence of notes there kind of sounded more like mighty morphing Power Rangers.

55
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:43.200
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Let's get ready to read news. Let's get ready to read news did. It did. It did. It did it now. Okay.

56
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.260
Chris Kerswell: Great, great thing train, by the way.

57
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.650
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Oh,

58
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.990
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Amazing mighty most empowering just

59
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.690
Chris Unwin (He/Him): That and Dragon Ball Z like

60
00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:05.280
Chris Unwin (He/Him): The one with the with the actual guitars that comes at the beginning phenomenal. But anyway, it is DDL and we have two bits of excellent news and then we have a beer. So first bit of good news.

61
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.790
Chris Unwin (He/Him): A bit of a harsh, bit of a drumroll

62
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.650
Chris Kerswell: I'm amazed how effective that is

63
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.200
Chris Unwin (He/Him): What did it sound quite good.

64
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.460
Chris Kerswell: Yeah dude, I go

65
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.670
Chris Kerswell: Stop.

66
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.560
Chris Kerswell: Yeah.

67
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:43.500
Chris Unwin (He/Him): DBS has hit 10,000 unique downloads. That's right. We've hit our 10,000 magic lesson moment or magic listener moment, I guess we should magic listens magic thing. Yay.

68
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.260
Chris Kerswell: Words what defines our lesson.

71
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.720
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Now I have to listen to all of it. Chris, all of it every second.

72
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.900
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I don't know either.

73
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:10.770
Chris Kerswell: But in any case, like what does YouTube markers or listen or Spotify. Anyway, no tangents Chris. Come on.

74
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:21.630
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Chris. Is there anything you would like to say to our wonderful listeners, given that we've just hit this monumental checkpoint.

75
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.890

78
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:54.150
Chris Unwin (He/Him): When we hit 10,000 listens. The wonderful producer Louise and the two of us, knuckleheads are going to be getting matching outfits and basically it's going to have our names and faces and stuff on and it's going to be wonderful. I'm gonna love it.

79
00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:04.920
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yeah, so if anyone didn't know how sad. We were IRL. They'll get to see us in our podcast supporting hoodies out IRL.

80
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.450
Yeah.

81
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.920
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yeah, so that was the piece that was the other piece of news anyway.

82
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:22.440
Chris Kerswell: All those people who listen to this podcast and live in deepest deepest deepest, darkest. That's why I got beakers from deepest, darkest East Anglia.

83
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:35.610
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yes, so I fed point. If you are a DB our listener and you live in the east of the UK, send us a tweet, because I'm really not sure where our listeners are from

84
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:47.190
Chris Unwin (He/Him): It'd be nice to be nice to take a quick poll. So if you're listening to dB. I'll send us a tweet, let us know where you're from. If you're from the east of ang the east of the East Anglia. The East of England.

85
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:47.970
Seminars

86
00:08:49.170 --> 00:09:02.640
Chris Unwin (He/Him): That would be, that would be great. But given the theme we're talking about locality and we're talking about, you know, the thing is, this is a January, unlike any January, we've ever felt because we're in lockdown.

87
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:12.630
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Or certainly we are here in the UK. And there are many, many countries around the world that have just gone back into lockdown and just coming out of lockdown.

88
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:23.520
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Some form of lockdown. It's, it is it is a bit of a blue January so we thought, you know what, given the local lockdown. We're going to get a nice local beer.

89
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.370
Chris Unwin (He/Him): For the podcast. So Chris, what have you got for us today.

90
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:35.880
Chris Kerswell: Well, I have got an order from a three blind mice brewery, which is a local TV beer.

91
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:49.350
Chris Kerswell: So these guys, they are three funnily enough individuals who decided to in their spare time, open a brewery three blind mice brewery, and it

92
00:09:49.890 --> 00:10:05.190
Chris Kerswell: Took off really well. They took the whole micro brewery thing and it exploded. So they've become a regular staple of the Cambridge beer festival by one Cambridge boat festival ran and we went to beer festivals and so person.

93
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:23.070
Chris Kerswell: they've opened a pub in the last few years, indeed equal to Draymond son great pub really nice job. And so I have from them. They're citrus oils. Now, which is probably not what they're most known for, but I've not had it before. So I want to give it a try.

94
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:33.000
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Now, that's really interesting. I've, I've had three blind mice before actually at some of the other beer festivals. So I think they were at the Cambridge winter beer festival once

95
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:33.960
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And

96
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.030
Chris Unwin (He/Him): They were also incident.

97
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:48.330
Chris Kerswell: Is someone. Yeah, my favorite beer that I've had was one called cigarettes and coffee. I believe it was a stout that tasted like cigarettes and go feels amazing.

98
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.060
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I mean you're not doing it justice.

99
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.070
Chris Unwin (He/Him): just tasted like you know cigarettes and coffee.

100
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:56.910
I mean, yeah.

101
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.490
Chris Unwin (He/Him): That's fair enough, I suppose.

102
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:04.440
Chris Unwin (He/Him): We're enjoying it over like a nice view. First thing in the morning, but we don't condone morning drinking

103
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:23.280
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Wonderful. So I have actually got myself here, a nice pack with brewery ale. So Papworth just up the road from me. This was actually purchased for me by my grandmother for Christmas. That's how you know you've

104
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.600
Chris Unwin (He/Him): made an impression when your grandmother's buying you alcohol.

105
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.630
Chris Kerswell: Is at least 5000 of our lessons.

106
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:37.470
Chris Unwin (He/Him): This is true, this is true. I'm not quite sure she knows what a Spotify is but we'll figure it out.

107
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:42.690
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Let's go with that.

108
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:56.100
Chris Unwin (He/Him): So this particular one is called the Whitfield cetera bolt. It's a citrusy golden ale. It's only about 3.8% it smells phenomenal because like a dingus. I've already

109
00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.490
Chris Unwin (He/Him): deleted it. So I can already smell it.

110
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.300
Chris Kerswell: Now why

111
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:11.430
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I don't know. I was in summer, I haven't had anything. I haven't had any alcohol, since the third of January. So we get that's something that's just over two weeks for me.

112
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:24.090
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I would say that's pretty good going. But yeah, trying to be a little bit healthier in January, trying not to drink so much, but I think this will be a well earned well deserved treat

113
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:31.260
Chris Unwin (He/Him): So without further ado, then Christian, we should we crack these open and get on with the gun with the podcast.

114
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:32.340
Let's

115
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.560
Chris Unwin (He/Him): To be fair, that was a good enough open for the both of us. So

116
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.970
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Now it's all in the Paul

117
00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:03.270
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I have no idea if I actually sounded like a good beer pouring. I'm going to look at producer Louise and see if she could hear it. Yeah. Thumbs up. Excellent.

118
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.900
Chris Kerswell: Right after I do the Louise might have to describe my job to someone

119
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:15.150
Chris Kerswell: What did you get up to today. Well, for a good period of time I sat on a zoom call and watch two idiots. Pour beer into

120
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.250
Chris Kerswell: Specifically to try and make as much noise as possible while they do that.

121
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.770
Chris Unwin (He/Him): It's like adult chuckle vision, isn't it, really.

122
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:34.320
Chris Unwin (He/Him): So all of our listeners who don't know what chuckle vision is you are thoroughly missing out. Google it immediately right now. Go ahead. I'll wait.

Chris Kerswell: Just asked him a lot of questions in Google things on your phone while you're in the surgery.

173
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:26.550
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Doctors, is it by swag with your face on that beats the January boos. That's the whole article

174
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.370
Chris Kerswell: I think that's the tip.

175
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.330
Chris Kerswell: Yeah, every

176
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.300
Chris Unwin (He/Him): retail therapy spend beyond your means

177
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:37.260
Chris Kerswell: No. Yeah.

178
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:48.360
Chris Unwin (He/Him): live a life of luxury and home where we can't leave. Anyway, now we are of course going to talk about how we're going to beat January and locked down and

179
00:18:49.680 --> 00:19:06.720
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Let's go with, let's go with number one. So Chris, and I've come up with five ideas. Each and we're going to say the idea and then we're going to explain the idea as well, of course, a good host always let's another good host go first. So, Chris.

180
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:08.550
Chris Unwin (He/Him): You go first.

181
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.980
Chris Kerswell: Oh, are will go first because I'm not attached to a bad host

182
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:15.570
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Is this

183
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.190
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Good host bad host

184
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.450
Chris Kerswell: Good host bad hires.

185
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:25.950
Chris Unwin (He/Him): It's like I'm, I'm the one who's like, Hey, welcome to DB L and you're like, why are you listening to DB Al Gore, I got nothing better to do.

186
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.730
Chris Kerswell: Yeah yeah like nagging the audience.

187
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:47.940
Chris Kerswell: So I am going to start with my top tip number one, there's going to be a lot of overlap here, I think, between all the screen about before and working from home because that Congress life now for a lot of people, and one of them wanted is

188
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.770
Chris Kerswell: Hygiene which sounds like a weird one. But

189
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.390
Chris Kerswell: Yeah.

190
00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.990
Chris Kerswell: You know a lot of people will adjust their work from home.

191
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:09.660
Chris Kerswell: I just day to day routine quite dramatically. I'm going to come onto route routine more later. Spoiler alert.

192
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:18.360
Chris Kerswell: And if you do things like wake up right up to your first meeting at nine o'clock straight out of bed still in your pajamas.

193
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:34.410
Chris Kerswell: That doesn't really set your set your well for the day, maintaining good hygiene and having a shower when you you know you usually would is highly recommend it because it just puts you in the right frame of mind to kick things off.

194
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.770
Chris Kerswell: And not only that, but

195
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.540
Chris Kerswell: Generally, there's a good correlation between feeling good.

196
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:51.210
Chris Kerswell: Health wines feeling good cleanliness wise and feeling good happiness wise, so help yourself out or shower.

197
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:58.980
Chris Unwin (He/Him): They do say that cleanliness is next to Godliness. And I, I enjoy starting my 9am meetings with a hefty God Complex.

198
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.350
Exactly, yes.

199
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.070
Chris Kerswell: For your summer meetings in your case.

200
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:11.940
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yeah. Well, I like the only ones. I actually, I actually prefer to shower at the end of the day, or after I've exercised but

201
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.290
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Mostly end of the day.

202
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:25.170
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And the reason that I like to shower at the end of the day is that I heard from I was listening to another podcast actually

203
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:39.510
Chris Unwin (He/Him): There's a podcast. Oh gosh. And this is great for Wellness. So if you're listening 100% go and check this podcast out, it's, it's the feel better live longer podcast by Dr rangan Chattahoochee

204
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:48.960
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And he's phenomenal and he has lots of guests on and they talk about everything from like mindfulness through diet through

205
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.080
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Sleep and everything like that.

206
00:21:52.260 --> 00:22:04.530
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And I'm pretty sure I heard. On one of his podcasts that if you have a shower before bed. It raises your body temperature significantly and the coming down of that body temperature.

207
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:11.880
Chris Unwin (He/Him): It imitates in some way that coming down of your body temperature when you fall asleep.

208
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:26.460
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Because when you fall asleep. Your body temperature drops. So if you start higher as your body temperature drops, whilst you're in bed it simulates that same experience which eases your body into sleeping.

209
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:32.970
Chris Kerswell: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. That is really good. Jeremy to just relax your muscles as well, like a hot so

210
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.000
Chris Kerswell: For me, I can do that if you try and get sleep.

211
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:44.490
Chris Kerswell: But then some people are just like me and sweat profusely during the night. So wouldn't really set me up well for the next day.

212
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.450
Chris Unwin (He/Him): We could always shower both, you know, there's no reason why you couldn't

213
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.500
Chris Kerswell: That's true.

214
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:54.090
Chris Kerswell: Because you couldn't have a short stay in the shower, just one continuous shower.

215
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.260
Chris Kerswell: Throughout all of lockdown.

216
00:22:55.470 --> 00:23:05.160
Chris Unwin (He/Him): We can all pretty much work from our phones and most phones these days are waterproof so become a prune live life in water summon the cracking and do some work.

217
00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:06.540
Chris Kerswell: Yeah, talk to her.

218
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:14.220
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Hey, so number two, then, is I'm going to take this one. It's going to be the opposite of

219
00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:28.200
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Getting further inside, you know, going to the shower. It's going to be the other direction out the front door and into nature. So my top tip is get outside and or get some vitamin D.

220
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:41.070
Chris Unwin (He/Him): So studies have shown that actually being closer to nature can bring about a huge amount of well being. One study showed that

221
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.800
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Just taking your socks off and walking barefoot.

222
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:49.560
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Across grass can have a really positive effect on your body as a whole.

223
00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:51.360
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And

224
00:23:52.440 --> 00:24:13.770
Chris Unwin (He/Him): It's surprising how just being around trees and grass and animals if possible. If you've got a park nearby. It doesn't take much just getting out is really important, and especially vitamin D. We need vitamin D to maintain a healthy body. If you live in an area like

225
00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:25.590
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I don't know if you live anywhere that sunny right now I'm looking at you, Australia, then you generally. Okay. Just make sure you don't burn. Make sure you take proper precautions with the sun.

226
00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:33.390
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And we don't have that problem here in the UK, where you know English summer is probably the best day of the calendar year.

227
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:34.830
Chris Unwin (He/Him): It.

228
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:45.750
Chris Unwin (He/Him): If you are, you know, living in an area that gets less than average sun in the Nordic countries in the UK, etc. Canada.

229
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:52.230
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Do make sure that you're taking any vitamin D supplements and keeping an eye on those vitamin D levels.

230
00:24:52.590 --> 00:25:05.130
Chris Unwin (He/Him): As being outside in nature and also getting a vitamin D. I suppose these are two points but coupled together can have a really positive impact on your well being mental health and happiness.

231
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.790
Chris Kerswell: Oh, make sense, yes.

232
00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.080
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I think so.

233
00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:11.940
Chris Kerswell: My number three. So,

234
00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:20.040
Chris Kerswell: kind of alluded to, but have a good routine and stick to the routine and people

235
00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:26.580
Chris Kerswell: Like routine in general, I know everyone's different. And some people breaking in very different ways but

236
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:38.700
Chris Kerswell: Yeah, we would usually have a routine and sticks that routine and usually before, for example, my routine would be get up, have a shower, get dressed. Right. Those are two words.

237
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:47.280
Chris Kerswell: That I continued from there and now the go to work, step is very definitely changed but

238
00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.330
Chris Kerswell: The routine is still there. It's just the community.

239
00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:58.050
Chris Kerswell: Yeah, I still see people just like these people virtually otherwise.

240
00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:05.190
Chris Kerswell: It's mostly the same still do the nine to five just in my house, rather than have you. Yeah.

241
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:15.870
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Now, it's interesting. I do find that routine generally does help. I found myself replacing the morning commute with

242
00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:23.610
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Like a nice healthy breakfast, whereas before I was getting to work, I was working a lot beyond the hours that I was actually

243
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:32.400
Chris Unwin (He/Him): You know contractually obliged to work because I was taking the bus early because I didn't like sitting on packed buses if I'd have, you know,

244
00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:41.280
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I could have just sat on the bus got on got to work by pop our state started work half past eight finished help us for offer pop on the way I'm

245
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.220
Chris Unwin (He/Him): But it wasn't really that simple.

246
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:53.010
Chris Unwin (He/Him): So I had to go in a bit earlier to avoid the crowd, get a seat on the bus, that sort of thing.

247
00:26:54.660 --> 00:27:08.550
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And I was doing a lot more work than was healthy for me. And, you know, often you do stay beyond our past for, don't you, you, you, you pull into one more meeting you grab someone on their way out the door by x y Zed.

248
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:13.920
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Naturally, you end up getting home kind of later and later within the so

249
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:28.080
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Actually, I found that this has inspired a much nicer routine. I've been able to cook much healthier food. I've been able to you know I get up off of my seat and I go over to the kitchen and I cook and we're eating at a reasonable time so

250
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:34.290
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Building out these routines are so good for you as well. And really good for kids as well for structure.

251
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:40.260
Chris Kerswell: Yeah. The other nice thing about routines. This is the same as well my habits bad habits.

252
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:49.860
Chris Kerswell: Routine is a really good way to introduce things that you want in your life. So going outside. For example, exercise, maybe

253
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:56.970
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Oh, well, that's an excellent point. Because my next recommendation, point, point number four, I think.

254
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:06.150
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Is exercise and drink lots of water. So it's actually combining a few of the previous points to get outside, get some vitamin D.

255
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:13.860
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And routine as well. Build exercise into that routine and you know it doesn't, you're not expected to be

256
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:28.320
Chris Unwin (He/Him): You know, Mo Farah Usain Bolt Jason Gatlin. No one expects you to break the sound barrier by running, although I do fiercely run past the slow down sign over near the school in my town.

257
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:39.180
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Because the moment you go above 20 miles an hour. It starts flashing at you. So I like to really run and see if one day or tell me to slow down. That's like my ultimate goal.

258
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.630
Chris Kerswell: But that's quite an aspiration is

259
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:47.670
Chris Unwin (He/Him): It's quite fast. I realized that 20 miles an hour is quite quick

260
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.660
Very

261
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.260
Chris Unwin (He/Him): But it's fine. I'm fine. I could do that.

262
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.850
Chris Kerswell: aspirational goals. Right.

263
00:28:53.970 --> 00:29:04.020
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yeah, exactly. It's nice to have something to shoot for. And occasionally, it's nice and a car comes driving up behind me as I'm running past here. I'm like, it's flashing and

264
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:07.980
Chris Kerswell: 23

265
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.720
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yes, exactly. And

266
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:19.080
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Exercise beyond just being good for you. I think we can all agree that exercise is good for your body, right, it helps you lose.

267
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.160
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Weight, it helps you stay

268
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:26.160
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Fit. It helps reduce inflammation outs. All these sorts of things helps reduce the chance of chronic disease.

269
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:32.310
Chris Unwin (He/Him): But it's just a good way to get out, get out of your own head.

270
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:43.440
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I like to put BBC Radio one on everyone's got their own jogging players. I just listened to Radio one and I liked listening to people like Nick Grimshaw and Scott Mills just talking

271
00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:50.400
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Because now you know Nick Grimshaw the other day had a, like a Harry Potter quiz off against the 12 year old girl.

272
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.470
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And they were just yeah they were answering questions. They were both getting

273
00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.430
Chris Kerswell: All the time you've diverted listeners away to other things.

274
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:11.130
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Well, they had this they had this Harry Potter quiz off and I'm just running along I'm not even paying attention to the fact that every limb in my body is going. We should stop. Let's find a pub.

275
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:21.630
Chris Unwin (He/Him): If it were open. Sit down and order chips and bear like my entire body is going well. But I'm not aware of that, because my brain is somewhere else. I'm like,

276
00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:32.370
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Oh, come on. It's the Sorting Hat. It's called the Sorting Hat and before I know it. I'm 40 minutes into a run. I back home. And that's it. It's

277
00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:34.260
Chris Unwin (He/Him): It's just a really good

278
00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.180
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Positive thing you can do for your body.

279
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.140
Chris Kerswell: Indeed, point number five.

280
00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:42.300
Chris Kerswell: The

281
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:55.800
Chris Kerswell: So this is one that will vary depending on your living situation and how fortunate you are and but I would say, having an isolated work area really really helps me personally.

282
00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:11.010
Chris Kerswell: Having somewhere that he even if it is a physical demarcation you make that isn't grounded in the actual physical objects. So, for example, stepping up stepping out the room stepping into the room.

283
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:18.540
Chris Kerswell: But having a location where you work in a location. We don't work is really important.

284
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.820
Chris Kerswell: So,

285
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:36.510
Chris Kerswell: If you don't do that, what you can find is that you will associate your living areas with work which can be a great way of making you feel like your work all the time, which

286
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:47.460
Chris Kerswell: Isn't a hugely positive feeling for a lot of people. Yeah, pretty easy way to introduce burner, but also mean that you won't as strictly maintained your routine.

287
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:56.700
Chris Kerswell: You won't work your nine to five or more work your night or seven which becomes your way your nine to nine. And then for, you know, you wake up you work, you go to sleep.

288
00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:14.220
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yeah. And even if you do, you know, even if we're talking metaphorically right even just being able to one of my favorite things is when it gets to Friday. My so Andrea and her cousin and I what we like to do is when the weekend rolls around.

289
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:21.750
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Given that we're under lockdown. We've been playing a lot of table. Table Top kind of fantasy role playing games like

290
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.120
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Mansions of Madness.

291
00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:42.330
Chris Unwin (He/Him): So that has been a really good staple in our house. We've got tons of expansions. We've got all the different like cards and tiles and scenarios. So we need to play that on our dining room table. Of course I work on my dining room table because, you know, my wife's in the in the office.

292
00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.760
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Cousins in a room.

293
00:32:46.140 --> 00:33:00.090
Chris Unwin (He/Him): There's nowhere else for me to go. So I've set my my I've set the desk up basically in such a way that it's really easy to fold everything away and to stack it down.

294
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:08.130
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Compact Lee by the side of the table so it doesn't hinder me putting it back up. It's not a hard thing to do.

295
00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:15.540
Chris Unwin (He/Him): You know, I can recreate my working environment within two minutes if I want to. But the point is, it's not on the dining room table.

296
00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:25.530
Chris Unwin (He/Him): So we're free to eat, to play board games with free to do whatever we like and that symbolically is more meaningful than I think having an actual separate room.

297
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:35.340
Chris Kerswell: Yeah, I think so. Again, another example here, like I'm in a room again. I'm lucky that I've got a room, I can dedicate to an office, but I've got

298
00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:53.550
Chris Kerswell: You know, I use this office for personal time as well as work time. It's just you. I don't let it bleed into one. So I always make sure I have a break between those two things happening if I'm going to switch machine and play on my PC, rather than working on my laptop.

299
00:33:54.570 --> 00:34:10.680
Chris Kerswell: Well then, as I said, Just go outside downstairs, come back in and then do something else. You know, that sounds a bit weird that you just leave the room and come in again. But that's the grab a drink. It's to go to the loo. It's to have didn't

300
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.230
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Do the things you would otherwise do in an office through

301
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.270
Chris Kerswell: Representative commute almost

302
00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:27.060
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, even just so much a standing up. I think a lot of people underestimate the power of standing up. But that's why we're seeing so many more standing desks. Now as well is that

303
00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:38.010
Chris Unwin (He/Him): You know, it's very easy at home to sit for so long. There are times where I'm sat down for four hours at a time on demonstrations at the red gate software.

304
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:45.630
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And then I stand up and my, my legs are like oh I forgotten about standing up or

305
00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:46.530
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And you're like,

306
00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:57.420
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Oh yeah, I should have done this a while ago. So that's why I'm making sure one of my top tips for that is not having too big, not having to bigger glass for water.

307
00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:01.170
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And then the moment the glass empties

308
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:11.310
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Go and get a new glass of water. Yes, it means you, you know, it means the hassle of refilling a glass more often. But it means that you stand up.

309
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:13.110
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And go and do something every

310
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.160
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Half an hour 40 minutes anyway. And that's really good.

311
00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.700
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I suppose that goes into your routine category, though.

312
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:29.850
Chris Kerswell: Yes, it does. I'm actually going to do another one of mine now because I was on. It was very closely related, if you don't mind. Chris So

313
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.170
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I mean, um, yeah. Go ahead.

314
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:46.440
Chris Kerswell: So speaking of commutes and missing your commute. For me, my commute was about half hour 45 minutes drive depending on traffic and that was time that I would listen to an audiobook

315
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.230
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And now you just go and sit in the car for half an hour.

316
00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:50.400
Chris Kerswell: Yeah, exactly.

317
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.740
Chris Unwin (He/Him): hands on the steering wheel not going anywhere.

318
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:01.020
Chris Kerswell: But I love audio books. I got really into them.

319
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:17.310
Chris Kerswell: But I've noticed that since lockdown 2020 started my audio book listening has gone down sharply, because I just don't have the time to do anymore, usually my times for listening to them would be household chores, it would be

320
00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:21.840
Chris Kerswell: Cooking commuting and go to the gym.

321
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:29.580
Chris Kerswell: You're going to the gym and commuting is now off the table, which means I only household chores and cooking, which

322
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:41.100
Chris Kerswell: You know, to our forums and bad, I guess, but it's just not as regularly and that time that time to just unwind and think about something else and

323
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:57.870
Chris Kerswell: Do something completely different. I think was definitely lost. And I think just recognize the fact that everyone needs a bit of you time and not just in yourself and other people as well. Like some people might want to just be on their phone for like 20 minutes or so.

324
00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:04.530
Chris Kerswell: It's it's a natural distinction and then natural. You don't even have to have you time

325
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:13.200
Chris Kerswell: Completely in your own isolated room by any means, but sometimes you time just means hanging out on the sofa and not interacting with someone

326
00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:23.820
Chris Kerswell: You know, we're all somewhere on the scale of introverts and extroverts and some people just recharge, a bit more from having their own personal space.

327
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:36.030
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Weirdly, you would think that I was too far on that scale to enjoy my own personal time and at the moment I'm left to my own devices. The voices when but

328
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:54.390
Chris Unwin (He/Him): But no, I am I, I completely agree. Sometimes all you need is a bit of time to just recharge just, you know, is these sorts of times where my brain. I'm just going, you do you, boo. Just take that time.

329
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.210
Chris Kerswell: And that's yourself as boo.

330
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.290
Boo.

331
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:08.790
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yeah course. Now you gotta love yourself, and that's giving yourself time time being the most precious resource.

332
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:13.380
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I think is one of the best ways of showing

333
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.610
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yourself love

334
00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.370
Chris Kerswell: This time sound like lyrics, too.

335
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.260
Chris Kerswell: Many a pop song I feel anyway. Carry on.

336
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:39.840
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Well, the carry on is just going to be my next point. So, interestingly, given that I was talking there about being grateful for time that I can spend, you know, by myself time that I can spend with my own thoughts to recharge.

337
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:46.080
Chris Unwin (He/Him): My next point my next tip, as it were, which I forgot what number tip it is but

338
00:38:47.130 --> 00:39:08.280
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Find something to be grateful for every day. It's really, really hard. You would think it's really easy. Okay, day one. I'm really grateful for having a roof over my head. Day two, I'm really grateful for Family Day three, I'm really grateful for the food on my table day for day 30

339
00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:17.940
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I'm really grateful I didn't stub my toe today know you've really got to come up with

340
00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:21.780
Chris Kerswell: Was be grateful that you don't have to say when you don't have to think

341
00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:27.840
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yes, oh my gosh, the single worst pain in the world.

342
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:39.180
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Of course to take. Yeah, very grateful for that. But interestingly, there's a lot of apps and a lot of different ways that you can record your gratitude.

343
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:44.550
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And you can even look back on it and and it can bring you joy in the future as well.

344
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:54.300
Chris Unwin (He/Him): So there's apps like happy feed happy feed is a good one, where you have to record three things that you're grateful for, at the end of the day, you can include pictures.

345
00:39:54.750 --> 00:40:03.360
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And that happy feed evolves over time so that you look back at the last year, the last two years, the last three years, kind of like the whole timeline thing.

346
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:04.560
Chris Kerswell: School

347
00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:12.810
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And effectively shows you the things that you were grateful for and reminds you of that and uses your past gratitude to make you happy again.

348
00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:20.760
Chris Unwin (He/Him): In the present and the future. So that's a really good one also keeping track of the things you love and that you're grateful for using like

349
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:36.690
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Passion planners, or there's like their six second diary. Now that's quite popular these sorts of things where you can record what you're grateful for. It's really, really good for just, you know, helping you stay thankful helping you stay grounded.

350
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.850
Chris Kerswell: Which brings me to a great segue into my final point, I believe.

351
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.010
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I've still got two left. Hahaha.

352
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:49.110
Chris Kerswell: I'm just being advantageous. Anyway, so

353
00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.300
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Advantageous

354
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:54.360
Chris Unwin (He/Him): A de de

355
00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:56.670
Chris Unwin (He/Him): De

356
00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:58.140
Mer.

357
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:10.890
Chris Kerswell: Sir lists and specifically to the list. And this is going to appeal to some types of people more than others, but it's very easy to feel overwhelmed.

358
00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:14.790
Chris Kerswell: A lot of time we

359
00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:26.190
Chris Kerswell: take on more tasks. Before we play things off. And there's two different analogies. I really like. First one is spinning plates.

360
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:31.500
Chris Kerswell: So we've all seen the spinning plates trick way you've got former who spends lots of plates.

361
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:41.880
Chris Kerswell: It's amazing how many plates, they can keep spinning and just keep adding the spinning plates spinning plates. But there's a limit. There's only so many placing keep spinning at a time.

362
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:53.160
Chris Kerswell: Need to recognize and realize this. The other analogy I really like is around children monkeys. So every task you take on as a treasury monkey every single one.

363
00:41:53.640 --> 00:42:05.760
Chris Kerswell: And you keep adding chattering monkeys and tutoring Monkeys. Monkeys with every new task, until eventually your head is just full with constant noise from these monkeys that are

364
00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:23.580
Chris Kerswell: Telling you, are you need to do this need to do this, you need to do this, you need to do this for me to do this your worry and anxiety about actually doing the tasks that you don't get around to hold you back from doing the tasks which clears out the monkeys.

365
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.340
Chris Kerswell: Easy way to

366
00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:39.240
Chris Kerswell: Break that down structure, it is quite simply to do lists, put a list of children monkeys that you have and then start methodically going through them break you.

367
00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:48.870
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Know, yeah. I completely agree. And I think sorting as well and prioritization comes into that way. You've got, you know, if you've got three or four children monkeys.

368
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:53.940
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Naturally, you can put them all down, it's kind of obvious which one. You've got to do and

369
00:42:54.750 --> 00:43:09.900
Chris Unwin (He/Him): If we were to explain it almost in database terms you know you've got processes here and maybe some a dead locking and you've got to figure out what what needs to be done to take out that deadlock, right, you've got to figure out the the blocking hierarchy there but

370
00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:24.270
Chris Kerswell: Yeah, I think sometimes it's like what you'll do is you'll put down to do this and yeah you prioritize it. This is most important, the most important, most people, most time consuming. If you literally just need to make yourself feel better than chance through the quick wins.

371
00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:24.690
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yeah.

372
00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:30.450
Chris Kerswell: And just check some of these things off. So you don't think or worry that your to do list is too long.

373
00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.390
Chris Kerswell: List is just the one important thing

374
00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:41.310
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Interestingly, whenever I make a to do list. The first item on that to do list is always make to do list.

375
00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:51.030
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And it sounds a bit silly, but actually making a to do list that's 1015 items long and then being able to take the first one off that

376
00:43:51.420 --> 00:44:01.350
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Hey, well, I've already started. I'm already 50 I'm already one 15th of the way to the end of the to do list. It gives you that feeling of accomplishment.

377
00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:05.880
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Because you've sat down, you've put pen to paper or fingertip phone or whatever.

378
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:24.960
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And you've got a list and actually sometimes. That's the first step. That's the hardest thing to do. And even if you defer certain tasks, even if they become pushed tasks that you can't achieve with the time given you've got them on a list. So you can always refer to that if you need to.

379
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:32.040
Chris Kerswell: My favorite way of doing this by the way is to divide it between urgency and importance.

380
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:39.420
Chris Kerswell: So this is what's known as an Eisenhower matrix split up your tasks between what is

381
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:48.780
Chris Kerswell: urgent and important urgent, but not important, important but not urgent and neither important nor urgent.

382
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:57.330
Chris Kerswell: And that gives you a very easy way to prioritize tasks and maybe even forget about some tasks you don't actually need to do

383
00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:11.130
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yeah, it's interesting, and were obviously a lot of tasks are similar in terms of importance or urgency, you could of course sort them into a different matrix which is like effort versus impact.

384
00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.600
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Which will then help with getting those quick wins.

385
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:23.100
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Cool. All right. Well, in that case, then, now that you've exhausted your list. Haha, I guess.

386
00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:24.570
Chris Unwin (He/Him): The last two

387
00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:35.760
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Tremendous so number nine is is quite simply message some old friends message. Some people you haven't spoken to in a while, who you miss or

388
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:55.680
Chris Unwin (He/Him): You know who it just hasn't been top of your agenda. Think back to school University. Think back to the friends that you've made and ping them a message, just send them a text or tweet. Yo, and Instagram message, whatever it is, just to let them know that you were thinking of them.

389
00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:13.230
Chris Unwin (He/Him): It might strike up a really cool conversation or at the very least, it might just make someone feel good make someone realized that someone was thinking about them. And yeah, that's just a really good way of staying connected with people when you feel like you can't be

390
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:17.220
Chris Kerswell: Absolutely really easy to feel I can either that alone. Yeah.

391
00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:34.080
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And the final one, then, is I think probably summed up quite nicely. And most of our points, but do something you love or find something new. You can love and, you know, this could be anything. This could be from, you know,

392
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.700
Chris Unwin (He/Him): firing up your

393
00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:45.840
Chris Unwin (He/Him): PC and playing the windows 95 classic Grim Fandango which I believe has been remastered and released on maybe steam and Gog

394
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:56.460
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Or it could be playing cards. It could be playing carcass on. I love carcass on or you know anything, video games films.

395
00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:11.790
Chris Unwin (He/Him): TV series, find a new series I've actually just speak to your point on routine. Chris, I actually have been watching both Star Trek discovery and also the chilling adventures of Sabrina on Netflix.

396
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:22.650
Chris Unwin (He/Him): As windows as one does. And what I've done is I found that I can fit an entire episode into my, into the period of time before I start work.

397
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:32.010
Chris Unwin (He/Him): If I have my break first and my first coffee of the day was watching and actually it's quite a nice way to start the day because I don't start the day thinking

398
00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:37.440
Chris Unwin (He/Him): You know, oh gosh, I've got that meeting and oh my goodness this is going to be such a problem or

399
00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:43.830
Chris Unwin (He/Him): You know house worries money worries, nothing like that. You literally start the day thinking

400
00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:51.330
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Or I'm really looking forward to that Barry porridge. And my coffee and. Oh, I wonder what's going to happen in Sabrina or Star Trek.

401
00:47:51.960 --> 00:48:01.020
Chris Unwin (He/Him): So find something that you love and do a little bit of it every day, whether it's painting or games or TV series, just do a little bit

402
00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:16.860
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And the cliffhanger. The, the thing, the thing that, you know, playing or watching leaves you on, you know, it inspires you to keep going and you know once you come to say the end of a TV series or the end of a show.

403
00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:23.820
Chris Unwin (He/Him): There's a million other ones out there. So just pick another one and then go again. And it you know

404
00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:37.950
Chris Unwin (He/Him): unless unless you're a university student right now. I doubt you could watch the entire catalog of everything on Netflix, Amazon Prime BBC I player. All of these sorts of series and streaming sites.

405
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.570
Chris Kerswell: Cool.

406
00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.290
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And of course, a bonus point. Listen to DB every day.

407
00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:49.470
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Oh, naturally go back and listen to our back catalogue. You got 27 episodes to pick from. Just pick one. Listen.

408
00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:50.280
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I can

409
00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:54.480
Chris Kerswell: Show your mom needs encouragement at this point. She's already changing them.

410
00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:02.910
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I can assure you it's 101% cruelty free except for in my direction and delicious because bear

411
00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.720
Chris Kerswell: Chris your delicious time be unkind to yourself.

412
00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:07.740
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Oh, you

413
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:11.370
Chris Kerswell: All right, then let's move on shall we

414
00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:22.620
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yeah, so we've taken up most of our time. We only have a little bit of time left. So a couple of things that we've got to update you on because we're moving now into

415
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:26.880
Chris Unwin (He/Him): The news.

416
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:29.850
I got

417
00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:31.830
Chris Unwin (He/Him): You read the room wrong.

418
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:35.010
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Okay, yeah.

419
00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:53.310
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Oh yeah. Welcome to the new are you doing it like a DJ a children's party.

420
00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:09.720
Chris Kerswell: At 630 vindaloo

421
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:17.040
Anyway, moving on the news. This is not going to be fun to edit. Moving on to the news.

422
00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:28.470
Chris Kerswell: So to to kind of one DVR specific piece of news and one red gate specific news that's actually really, really exciting. So

423
00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:31.320
Quiet.

424
00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:33.570
Can you still hear me.

425
00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:45.570
Chris Kerswell: Maybe not the mic. Did I knock knock knock.

426
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:47.430
Chris Kerswell: Knock, knock.

427
00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.600
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Knock the mic. Oh.

428
00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:55.260
Chris Kerswell: I don't know why but yeah you've your volume levels drastically reduced.

429
00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:57.060
Chris Unwin (He/Him): So, can you hear me if I speak like this.

430
00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:03.480
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yes. Okay. Well, I'll just be really very intimate and close with the microphone.

431
00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:05.520
Chris Kerswell: Oh,

432
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:13.770
Chris Unwin (He/Him): For the benefit of those listening at home. I just made tongue waggling motions at my microphone.

433
00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:28.800
Chris Unwin (He/Him): So the first piece of news is congratulations to the winner of the DB ale end of year beer competition, your beer is winging its way all the way to you in sunny Northern England.

434
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:47.880
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Of course, tough luck to anyone else who entered obviously hotly contested, but there's always later on there's always going to be more chances for you to win. So do keep listening and you never know when you might win a crate of DB ale beer.

435
00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:51.780
Chris Kerswell: So, for the record is not dB or beer.

436
00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:54.720
Chris Unwin (He/Him): No, it's not. It's beer. Yeah, that's

437
00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:55.650
Chris Unwin (He/Him): This is true.

438
00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:57.930
Chris Kerswell: yet learned take notes.

439
00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:06.960
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yeah, Lou anyway. The second piece of news which is actually really exciting is that

440
00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:09.540
Chris Kerswell: So my palate. Oh.

441
00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:11.760
Chris Unwin (He/Him): No, you can take that one in a minute.

442
00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:14.790
Chris Unwin (He/Him): No, then the next one is that red gate.

443
00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:27.030
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Is actually conducting a red gate summit on February the 17th and 18th of 2021 2021 is obviously the big year for database DevOps.

444
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:41.910
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And we've got a lot of different database technologies, a lot of push towards the cloud. A lot of onus on CI and CD moving into 2021. So what is it all about and how do we get started. Well, interestingly, if you go to

445
00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:44.610
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Read dash gate.com forward slash

446
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:53.220
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Hub and click on events or go to a red dash eight.com forward slash forward slash events. I'm not going to tell you how to get there, but go there.

447
00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:58.260
Chris Unwin (He/Him): You'll find a little banner that says the red gate.

448
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:12.600
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Summit, the future of database DevOps and you can actually sign up, you can actually register for this event. Now there's going to be some incredible sessions from some amazing speakers, including

449
00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:27.060
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Promote the director of thought works. We've got that right guys. Very own grant Richie Steve Jones, Kendra little etc. Some powerhouses of the database world, including Kellen pop and Gorman

450
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:46.800
Chris Unwin (He/Him): From Microsoft john Martin Samir Bukhara Carlos Rob layers Kathy kellenberger there's there's tons of people taking part. It's tremendous and there's going to be a ton of information on adopting database DevOps cross DB database DevOps a whole bunch of other things, basically.

451
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.660
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Red dash k.com forward slash

452
00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:56.640
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Forward slash events and you'll be able to get your superstar ticket for that event as well, so don't miss out, go and sign up now.

453
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:05.190
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And those were the DB and red gate news. So Chris, did you have a

454
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:11.940
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Did you have a piece of news to finish us off something that's perhaps data breach related

455
00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:13.890
Chris Kerswell: So two quick

456
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.150
data breaches.

457
00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:17.490
And average monthly

458
00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:22.920
Chris Kerswell: Things you love what Capcom games do you love, Chris.

459
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:27.000
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I'm a big fan of Resident Evil four

460
00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:38.610
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Predominantly for the person that you buy things off of the trader, just because when you go up to them. They go what lip be stranger.

461
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:53.460
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And for some reason, I just I harmonize with that I kind of feel like I would say that if I was working at a supermarket, like if they came up like working at all costs, and they come up with a ticket and like what led be stranger.

462
00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:55.590
Chris Kerswell: Like so much free time.

463
00:54:55.650 --> 00:55:01.470
Chris Unwin (He/Him): I'm looking for. I'm looking for a shoe box and a lamp. Good choice.

464
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:04.590
Chris Kerswell: This is the deli counter though.

465
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:06.960
Chris Kerswell: So,

466
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:12.750
Chris Kerswell: Anyway can home were hit by a

467
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:14.700
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Car and

468
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.740
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Video Game form. Oh.

469
00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:19.710
Chris Kerswell: So,

470
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:32.460
Chris Kerswell: Some someone somewhere probably a specific group of people who have a specific ransomware called Ragnar locker.

471
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:40.380
Chris Kerswell: Targeted Capcom I'm installed this bit of software. So we've heard of ransomware before it essentially

472
00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:53.460
Chris Kerswell: Spreads maliciously across an infected system and encrypts a huge amount of files and then charges. Your ransom to encrypted. This is a fairly interesting spin on that take

473
00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:59.550
Chris Kerswell: Or it does the exact same thing except instead of encrypting it in order to

474
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:09.900
Chris Kerswell: Give it back to you. It also downloads copies of it and threatens you with a data breach effectively by saying that we're going to release all the data we found

475
00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:15.150
Chris Kerswell: If you don't pay as well as you're not getting the copies of data back

476
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:26.670
Chris Kerswell: So in the modern day, you're probably taking backups. And if you're taking regularly scheduled backups, or if you're using appropriate records management actually might be pretty well protected if someone

477
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:43.140
Chris Kerswell: Decides to just encrypt all your data you've got three copies of every file anyway on one drive and SharePoint and Dropbox or whatever system you're using as well as your local machine. So this is kind of a clever way to also get that ransom out of people.

478
00:56:44.640 --> 00:57:02.130
Chris Kerswell: And so yeah, they the group who have created this bit of ransomware infected it on the Capcom system Capcom evidently didn't pay the ransom. And so the data was published on the Ragnar Locklear website.

479
00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:02.880
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And the

480
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:12.150
Chris Kerswell: Website, but the website located on the dark web. So feel free to access that if you so feel the need

481
00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.960
Chris Unwin (He/Him): To encourage people to the dark web Chris

482
00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:18.960
Chris Kerswell: Second one is

483
00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:22.920
Chris Kerswell: very relevant. I guess but Pfizer hit

484
00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:30.810
Chris Kerswell: Well, not specifically Pfizer, but the European Medical Association. I believe that's what AMA stands for

485
00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.120
Chris Kerswell: And Medicines Agency, sorry.

486
00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:37.800
Chris Kerswell: So they were hit by a cyber attack from a

487
00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:42.300
Chris Kerswell: What has been loosely termed as a

488
00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.260
Chris Kerswell: Specific national agency.

489
00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:52.620
Chris Kerswell: No one's specifically saying who the national agency probably is, but

490
00:57:53.550 --> 00:58:02.640
Chris Kerswell: You can guess. It's one of to the fact that the data showed up on a Russian message board on the dark web then kind of gives you a bit more of an indication

491
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:15.630
Chris Kerswell: And specifically, what was taken was a selection of documents that related to the Pfizer and the operators, the Medina vaccine Madonna vaccine. Sorry.

492
00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:29.130
Chris Kerswell: So the trial information. So back and forth emails peer reviews that information was taken and then modified before being released to the public.

493
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:31.200
Chris Kerswell: Specific

494
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:38.130
Chris Kerswell: Intention of throwing the vaccines integrity into down because of course it was.

495
00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:39.930
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yeah. Interesting.

496
00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:48.300
Chris Kerswell: So yeah, to, to, I guess it's two databases, more specifically to hacks this this

497
00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:59.880
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Yeah, really interesting. Yeah, I don't think we've had an accidental data breach for a little while now we're starting to we're getting more on to just hackers and ransomware and that sort of thing, but

498
00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.160
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Interesting all the same.

499
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:14.460
Chris Unwin (He/Him): But lo and behold, we've hit our, our time we've talked about ways of getting through the January blues, how to be a bit more positive bit more upbeat in today's world.

500
00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:21.780
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And of course, we just want to say we didn't just pass over the 10,000 lessons earlier course we didn't

501
00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:33.360
Chris Unwin (He/Him): We just want you to know that we are here in dB L really really pleased to be offering a podcast that people listen to and hopefully people like

502
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:42.810
Chris Unwin (He/Him): If you'd like to just send us a tweet and let us know how long you've been listening. If you're a first time listener or if you've been with us.

503
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:47.610
Chris Unwin (He/Him): since the very beginning, since, you know, the very first few lessons that we had

504
00:59:48.120 --> 01:00:03.870
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Now that we've hit 10,000 we'd love to hear from you. If you are a regular listener, just send us a tweet at Kurzweil Chris at plant based sequel, it would absolutely make our days to hear if you've a made it the whole way through this podcast. In fact, well done.

505
01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:07.110
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And secondly, if you've stuck with us.

506
01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:14.910
Chris Unwin (He/Him): Through the years. Now, let alone the month. So it's a massive, massive thank you for me.

507
01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:16.860
Chris Kerswell: Very easy for me.

508
01:00:17.550 --> 01:00:19.470
Chris Unwin (He/Him): And for now, yes.
